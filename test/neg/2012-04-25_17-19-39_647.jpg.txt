ieee transacttons on robotics and automation vol no june segmentation via manipulation constantine j tsikos and ruzena k bajcsy senior member ieee abstract we introduce the paradigm f iterative interactive the traditional approach is to segment the noncontact scene segmentation and simplification of random heaps of un sensory information intensity known objects via vision and manipulation the scene simpllf range etc regardless of cation is based on the graph operations of vertex and edge scene complexity then based on the outcome of segmenta removal these operations are defined isomorphic to the pick tion to interpret the scene and recognize the objects the and push manipulation actions we use the sensors as graph problem with this approach is that reliability decreases when generators and the manipulator as the decomposing mechanism scenes become more complex and when priori assumptions of the graphs the model is nondeterministic finitestate tur arc removed machine we integrated vision system manipulator and force torque and other sensory input into robot work cell and our approach is different instead of trying t deal with an conducted experiments t test convergence and error recovery of ever increasing visual scene complexity we use the manipu four different strategies we found that under certain conditions lator to make the scene simpler for the vision system the strategies can tolerate errors in the sensory data recover paradigm is analogous to the hand help the eye when from pathological states and converge interpretation of visual information is ambiguous or when the scene is visually complex i introduction our system is iterative because random arrangements of he motivation for this paper is the observation that a objects form layers due t our noncontact sensor arrange t scene containing more than one object most of the time ment only the layer of the heap is visible at any given cannot be segmented only by vision or in general by any time and the objects are removed from the scene one at a noncontact sensing method visual information may be suf time in general the system must sense and manipulate more ficient to accurately segment simple objects and nonoverlap than once for every random scene ping scenes however in general it is not sufficient for the system is interactive because the vision system may random heaps of unknown objects request a manipulatory action to resolve an interpretation if no a priori knowledge is available the vision system ambiguity to reducc visual complexity or to grasp and cannot reliably distinguish between overlaps caused by two remove an object from the scene the manipulatory action different objects in the scene and overlaps caused by single must be monitored by the noncontact sensor vision system selfoccluding object a flat rigid object supported by and as well as the contact sensors force torque in closed totally occluding another smaller object may be recognized as a assumptions a large boxshaped object similarly a flat nonrigid object supported in the middle by a smaller object may be recog our assumptions are nized as convex while if it is supported at the cdges by more the scene is reachable by the manipulator and accessible than one object it may be recognized as concave t the sensors ie the entire scene is visible although therefore machine vision alone or any noncontact sens occlusions may occur ing method is not sufficient for segmentation and recogni the scene is decomposable it consists of convex objects tion an exception to this may be the case when the objects held together by the forces of gravity and friction are physically separated so that the noncontact sensor can the objects may or may not be rigid their size and measure this separation r one knows priori a great deal weight is such that are manipulable with a suitable end effector the complexity of the scene is bounded ie about the objects their geometry material etc typical scenes are three to six layers and may contain to objects manuscript received march revised january this work there is well defined state that is detectable by the was supported
