arc extraction algorithms which operate on groups of pixels and which output arc paramcters such as centecr radius and endpoints in addition to thc width of the original arc what we need is the machine vision analog of a system engineering method this methodology can be encapsulated in protocol which has a modeling component d theoretical error propagation component an experimental compo nent and data analysis component the next section describes in greater detail these components of an image analysis engineering protocol protocol the modeling component of the protocol consists of a description of the world of ideal images a description of a random perturbation model by which nonideal images arise and a specification of the criterion function by which the difference between the ideal output and the computed output arising from the imperfect input can be quantified the experimental component describes the experiments performed under which the data relative to the performance characterization can be gathered the analysis component describes what analysis must be done on the experimentally observed data to determine the performance characterization the theoretical error propagation component is theoretical analysis which determines an approximation of the characteristics of the random perturbation on the output a a function of the random perturbation on the input image generation this of the protocol describes how in accordance with the specified model suitably random independent and representative set of images from the pop ulation of ideals is to be acquired or generated to constitute the sampled set of images this tion can be done by taking real images under the specified con ditions or by generating synthetic images if the population includes for example range of sizes of the object of intcrest or if the object of interest can appear in variety of situations or if the object shape can have range of variations then the sampling mechanism must assure that reasonable number of images are with the object appearing in sizes orientations and shape variations throughout its permissible range similarly if the object to be recognized or measured can appear in variety of different lighting conditions which create similar variety in shadowing then the sampling must assure that images are acquired with the lighting and shadowing varying throughout its permissible range some of the variables used in the image generation process are ones whose val ues will be estimated by the computer vision algorithm we denote these variables by k other of these variables are nuisance variables their values pro vide for variation the performance characterization is averaged over thcir values ology part aquisit sampled
