waferscale integration ofa large systolic for adaptive cm rader this article describes an architecture for a highly parallel system of processors that are specialized for realtime adaptive antenna nulling computations with many degrees of freedom this system is called the matrix updatc systolic experiment muse and we describe a specific realization of muse for degrees of freedom each processor uses the coordinate rotation digital computation cordic algorithm and has been designed as a single integrated circuit ninetysix such processors can update the gelerent nulling weights on the basis of new observations in only msec this rate would require billion instructions per sccond from a conventional processor the computations support db of signaltointerference ratio sinr improvement in sidelobe canceler the simple connectivity between processors permits muse to be realized on a single large wafer by restructurable vlsi hen an antenna array of n elements is pendence of the computational cost of adaptive weight w subject t undesired interference such a determination a previous study of computational cost jamming plus the thcrmal noise in cach of set this limit at n based on an assumed conven the n receivers the interference power can be reduced tional digital signal processing architecture this limita relative to the power in some desired signal by forming tion is not absolute bccause it depends on the icsources as the system ourput suitably weighted sum of the we arc allocate nulling processor waveforms observed on all the antenna elements we call more resources however is notan efficient way to handle this process usually the choice ofsuitable weights a number of antennas must be made adaprively the choice of weights that in this article wc describe a specialized adaptive maximizcs the signaltointerference ratio sinr ob processor called the matrix update systolic experircnt served in the system ourput is the solution i a well muse which is of determining the weights studied leastsquares problern the number ofarithmetic for n anrenna clements bccause of its novel archi steps required t solve this lcastsquares problem for tecture i can be compactly rcalized by using restructur almost any algorithr chosen is proportional to the cube able waferscale integration the resulting system fits in of the number of antenna elements furthermore be a in square muse is substantially smaller and light cause the statistical characteristics of the interference er than a conventional processor and it uscs substantial with time the adaptive weight determination ly less power although the muse processor is must be performed repetitively and in real time ized for n antennas the muse design conccpt when the antenna array is on board a satellite the can be applied t the design of similar processor number of antenna elements that can be nulled in prac for an antenna array with different number of tice is limited by the combination of the realtime ic clcments quirement driven by satellite motion and the cubic de we briefly the mathematics of adaptive f rci p jonrri array nulling working together update using using willing large nulling nulling aapable special change null explain
