realtime control of virtual human using minimal sensors vorman badler michael j hollick john p granieri computer graphics rescarch laboratory department of computer and information science university of pennsylvania philadelphia pennsylvania abstract we track in realtime the tion and posture of human body using minimal number of dof sen sors to capture full body standing postures we use sensors to create approximation o humnan operator ition and posture and map it on t out articulated computer human model the unsensed joints are positioned by a fast inverse kine matics algorithm our is to rcalistically recreate human postures while minimally encumbering the op erator background ideally virtual environment interface should be able to measure and recreate a participants posture exact ly rather than the traditional disembodied hand approach we like to generate complete istically postured human image however the equip ment needed accurately track every body segment or joint angle of a human is costly and cumbersome we face several questions how closely must the vir tual human posture match the operator and how much information do we nced to achieve this degree of realism as in other areas of vr the degree of realism nec essary depends greatly on the tasks wc would like to perform we have concentrated on creating an interface that will allow a human participant to perform basic tasks using a minimal number of sen figure sensor placement and support polygon sors to derive feasible reasonably accurate postures three pieces of information are essential for our pos ture reconstruction algorithm the participant view vector center of mass and the location of the end effectors the participant will use to interact with the posi good posi graphics goa real would to
