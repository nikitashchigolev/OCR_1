figure processinq mage sequences to be wasted on segments that cannot be reconstructed accurately because their d orientation is parallel t the direction of motion generally the line detector ignores many undesirable segments that result from nonarchitectural elements the scene which should not appear in a cad model such as people walking by this too makes wrong matches less likely results k results and eualuation figure shows one image in a sequence and the corresponding d line segments the barrel distortion visible in the intensity image is corrected before the line detector is run results of the reconstruction of vertical edges in this indoor scene are shown in figure the vertical are represented by small both views are shown over a one meter spacing the lelt map represents actual measurements in the scene the right map is the result of the reconstruction the robot was moving up in the map acquiring an image every meter the last position of the robot is represented by small dot at the bottom of the map the comparison of the two maps shows that the accuracy of the reconstruction can approach the precision of an architectural foor plan in fact in some instances the edges signs top grid
