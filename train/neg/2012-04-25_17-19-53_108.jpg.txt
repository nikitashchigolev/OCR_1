ieee transactions on robotics and automation vol no june segmentation via manipulation constantine j tsikos and ruzena k bajcsy senior member ieee abstract introduce the paradigm of iterative interactive the traditional approach is to segment the noncontact scene segmentation and simplification of random heaps of un sensory information range intensity etc regardless of known objects via vision and manipulation the scene simplifi scene complexity then based on the outcome of segmenta cation is based on the graph operatlons of vertex and edge removal these operations are defined isomorphlc to the pick tion to interpret the scenc and recognize the objects the and push manipulation actions we use the sensors as graph problem with this approach is that reliability decreases when generators and the manipulator as the decomposing mechanism scenes become more complex and when priori assumptions of the graphs the model is nondeterministic finitestate tur are removed machine we integrated a vision system manipulator and our approach is different instead of trying to deal with an force torque and other sensory input into robot work cell and conducted experiments t test convergence and error recovery of ever increasing visual scene complexity we use the manipu four different strategies we found that under certain conditions lator to make the scene simpler for the vision system our the strategies can tolerate errors in the sensory data recover paradigm is analogous to having the hand help the eye when from pathological states and converge interpretation of visual information is ambiguous or when the scene is visually complex i introduction our system is iterative because random arrangements of he motivation for this paper is the observation that a objects form layers due to our noncontact sensor arrange scene containing more than one object most of the time ment only the top of the is visible at any given in time and the objects are removed from the scene one at a cannot be segmented only by vision or by any noncontact sensing method visual information may be suf time in general the system must sense and manipulate more ficient to accurately segment simple objects and nonoverlap than once for every random scene scenes however in general it is not sufficient for the system is interactive because the vision system may ping request a manipulatory action to resolvc an interpretation random heaps of unknown objects and if no a priori knowledge is available the vision system ambiguity to reduce visual complexity or to grasp reliably distinguish between overlaps caused by two remove an object from the scene the manipulatory action cannot must be monitored by the noncontact sensor vision system different objects in the scene and overlaps caused by a single and as well as the contact sensors force torque in a closed selfoccluding object a flat rigid object supported by totally occluding another smaller object may be recognized as a assumptions large boxshaped object similarly a fat nonrigid object supported in the middle by smaller object may be recog our assumptions are nized as convex while if it is supported at the edges by more the scene is reachable by the manipulator and accessible than one object it may be recognized as concave to the sensors ie the entire scene is visible although therefore machine vision alone or any noncontact sens occlusions may occui method is not sufficient for segmentation and recogni the scene is decomposable it consists of convex objects ing tion an exception to this may be the case when the objects held together by the forces of gravity and friction the objects may or may not be rigid their size and are physically separated that the noncontact sensor can is such that are manipulable with suitable measure this separation or one knows priori a great deal end weight effector the complexity of the scene is bounded ie about the objects their geometry material etc typical scenes are three to six layers deep and may contain to objects manuscript received march revised january this work there is well defined state that is detectable by the i supponted by the us
