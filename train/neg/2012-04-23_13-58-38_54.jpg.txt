waferscale integration ofa large systolic for adaptive nulling cm rader this article describes an architecture for a highly system of processors that are specialized for realtime adaptive antenna computations with many degrees of frccdom this system is called the matrix update systolic experiment muse and we describe a specific realization of muse for degrees of freedom each processor uses the coordinate rotation digital computation cordic algorithm and has bcen designed as single integrated circuit ninetysix such processors working ca the element nulling weights on the basis of new observations in only msec this update rate would require billion instructions per second from conventional processor the computations support s db ofsignaltointerference ratio sinr improvement in a sidelobe canceler the simple connectivity between processors permits muse to be realized on single wafer by using restructurable vlsl hen an antenna array of n elements is pendence of the computational cost of adaptive weight w subjcct t undesired interference such as derermination a previous study of computational cost jamming plus the thermal noise in each of set this limit at n based on an assumed conven the n rcceivers the interference power can be reduced tional digital signal processing architecrure this limita relative r thc powcr in some dcsired signal by forming tion is nor absolute because it dcpends on the resources the sstem output suitably sum of the we are allocate nulling processor wavcforms obsencd on all the antenna elements we call more resources however is notan efficient way to handle this prxess usually the choice of suitable number of antennas must b made adapavely the choice of weights that in this artidle we describe a specialized adaprvenulling maximie thc interference ratio sinr ob processor called the matrix update systolic experiment sned in the system output is the solution t wel muse which is of derermining the wcights srudicd kas thc numbcr of arithmetic for n antenna clements bccausc of ilts novel archi required t solve this leastsquarcs problem for tecture if can be compactly realized by using restructur stcps anost igorithm choscn is proportionil t the cube able waferscale integration the rcsulting sstem fits in an f thc numtr of antenna clements furthermorc b lin squarc muse is substantially smaller and light thc statistici charactenstcs of the interference er than conventional processor and it uscs substantial gr changr with timc the dtemminution ly less power although thc muse proccssor is mut t perforned rcpetitncly and in rcal time ized for n antennis thc muse design concept win t antcn atry v on bard atcllie thc cin be o the design ot simibr proccrsr pumbet f sntct ckncnts thxt can xr nulied in prc tor an antcnni any wuh diftercnt number nce amnitu thc rombinadon thc nlaimc r dements quitcmcnt unyrn by atcilitta motin and thc cubic wc bricfty cxpluin the mathcmatics of aipme nul array parallel nulling togcther update large using willing weighted weights large nulling sgnalto apable problem sul cight adaprnve applicd
