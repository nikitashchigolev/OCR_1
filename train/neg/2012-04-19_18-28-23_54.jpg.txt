realtime control of a virtual human minimal sensors norman badler michael j hollick john p granieri computer graphics research laboratory department of computer and information science university of pennsylvania philadelphia pennsylvania abstract we track in realtime the ition and posture of a human body a minimal number of dof sen sors to capture full body standing postures we use sensors to create a approximation of a human operator position and posture and map it on to our articulated computer graphics human model the unsensed joints are positioned by fast inverse kine matics algorithm our is to realistically recreate human postures while minimally encumbering the op erator background ideally virtual environment interface should be able to measure and recreate a participant posture exact ly rather than the traditional disembodied hand approach we would like to generate a complete istically postured human image however the equip ment needed to accurately track every body segment or joint angle of a human is costly and cumbersome we face several questions how closely must the vir tual human posture match the operator and how much information do we need to achieve this degree of realism as in other areas of vr the of realism nec essary depends greatly on the tasks we would like to perform we have concentrated on creating an interface that will allow a human participant to perform basic tasks a minimal number of sen figure sensor placement and support polygon sors to derive feasible reasonably accurate postures three pieces of information are essential for oui ture reconstruction algorithm the participants vicw vector center of mass and the location of the end effectors the participant will use to interact with the using posi using good goal real degree using pos
