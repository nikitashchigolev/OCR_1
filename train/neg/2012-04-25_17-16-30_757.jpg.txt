adiir a testbed for experiments in document image indexing and retrieval paul thompson and robert kellogg prc inc prc drive mclean va abstract of optically stored raster images becomes increasingly important typically such files the automated document image are indexed manually at great expense while indexing and retrieval adiir research search methods are crude improved retrieval ject seeks t address the need for rapid effec methods are needed the automated tive access t information in multimedia document image indexing ad retrieval databases in particular those with document adiir research project seeks to address images with new techniques for capturing these needs with new techniques for captur and indexing document images new algo ing and indexing images new algorithms for rithms for effective retrieval from largescale effective retrieval from large text and image text and image databases and intelligent databases and intelligent interface design interface design including integrated text and including integrated text and image retrieval image retrieval in this paper we give short in this paper we give a short description of the description of the project as a whole with an project as a whole with an emphasis on the emphasis on the document image analysis document image analysis portion and a brief portion and a brief account of our perfor account of our performance at the text mance al the text retrieval conference retrieval conference trec trec the adiir project introduction the first longterm objective of the adiir throughout the information processing project is to develop effective computation industry there is a need for effective ally implemented retrieval algorithms that can access t information in databases containing efficiently scale up for very large text and text formatted data graphics and other mul image retrieval systems the second is to timedia engineering drawings sound develop an automatic indexing engine that and video furthermore as conversion of will capture key elements of a scanned docu large volumes of paper documents and techni ment based on document class and common cal manuals into electronic raster format zone patterns eliminating costly manual accelerates the need for fast accurate index indexing the third is t develop indexing ing pro rapid eg
