robotex an autonomous mobile robot for precise surveying xavier lebegue and j k aggarwal computer and vision research center dept of electrical and computer the unwversity of tecas at austin austin tecas usa abstract the robotex project aims at automatically constructing an exact cad representation of buildings a mobile robot this paper reports on the current status of the project the hardware of the robot is described with special emphasis on issues relating to measuremen t accuracy and algorithms used to process the sequences of monocular images acquired by the robot are presented results of automatic indoor surveying are shown and compared to direct measurements in the scene the techniques developed here have important applications in architec tural surveying scene understanding and precise robot navigation introduction this paper describes robotex a mobile robot especially designed for building accurate d maps of its environment the of the robotex project is to enable a robot to automatically explore a building to construct a very accurate cad representation this cad representation should be as close as possible to what an architect would generate traditionally the tasks of robot perception system are to detect obstacles find the free space and estimate the ition of the robot in the world here the focus is on building a useful d description of the world our d representation of the environment differs primarily from representations used by other robots in that it must concentrate on semantically significant features it must be more accurate than is strictly necessary for navigation alone to satisfy the first constraint we chose to concentrate on straight edges with ular orientations in the d scene typically there are three prominent d orientations in indoor scenes and outdoor urban scenes the vertical and two horizontal orientations perpendicular to each other our approach considers only polyhedral objects with such edges this assumption holds for most large architectural features such as walls door ways floors and ceilings the constraint accuracy has multiple implications for both the hardware and the software of the robot this rescarch was supported in part by the dod joint services electronics program through the air force office of scientific research afsc contract fc and in part by the army research office under contract daalog engr using goal posit partic second
