arc extraction algorithms which operate on groups of pixels and which output arc parameters such as center radius and endpoints in addition to the width of the original arc what we need is the machine vision analog of a systems enginecring method this met hodology can be encapsulated in protocol which has modeling component a theoretical crtor propagation component a experimental compo nent and data analysis component the next section describes in greater detail these components of n image analysis engineering protocol protocol the modeling component of the protocol consists of description of the world of ideal iages description of random perturbation model by which nonideal images arise and a specification of the criterion function by which the difference betweet the ideal oulput and the computed output arising from the imperfect input can be quantified the experimental component describes the experiments performed under which the data relative to the performance characterization can be gathered the analysis component describes what analysis must be done on the experimentally observed data to determine the performance characterization the theoretical error propagation component is theoretical atalvsis which determines approximation ol the characteristics of the random perturbation on the output s function of the random perturbation on the input image generation this part of the protocol describes how in accordance with the specified model suitably random independent and representative set of images from the pop ulation of ideals is to be acquired or generated t constitute the samnpled set of images this ition can be done by taking real images under the specified con ditions or by generating hetic images ifthe population ineludes lor example range of sizes of the object of interest or if the object of interest can appear in variety of situations or if the object shape can have a range of variations then the sampling mechanism must assure that a reasonable number of images are sampled with the object appearing in sizes orientations and variations throughout its pernussible range similarly if the object to be recognized or measured can apper i variety of different lighting conditions which create sirular variety in shadowing then the sampling must assufe thal itages are acquired with the lighting and shadowing varying throughout its permissible range some of the variables used in the itnage generation process are ones whose val ues will be estimnated by the computer vision algorithmn we denote these variables by ke other of these variables are nuisance variables theit values vide for variation the perfortnance characterixation is averaged over their values olegy aquisie stt shape pnoe
